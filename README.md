# resume
This is an online resume I built using HTML/CSS as a means to begin learning web developement.
There is a seperate 'index.html' file for the HTML code
a 'style.css' file for the css stylesheet
an 'img' folder containing relevant images.

I built this project via brackets and deployed it via the FAU lamp server.
